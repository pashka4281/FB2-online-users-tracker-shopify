# FB2 online users tracker for shopify
small script to enable online users presence counter for funnel builder pages on shopify


## How to use:

In order to enable live visitors counter on for FB pages you need to insert this script onto every page using "settings" -> "custom body script" option. I recommend using minified version of the script (will save you page downloading time) that can be found inside tracker.min.js file.

Please make sure to surround the script content with <script>... </script> tags as otherwise FB2 script editor may cut it off after saving and it won't work.

Once inserted and saved you should notice immediately that FB2 page visits trigger live counter to go up (provided that you set your storeId inside the script to a proper value).
